Mr. Villegas is seen today.  I have not seen him since November. 
About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
he was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are
definitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the
relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
right.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This
only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has
no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
cranial complaints.  
 
On examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the
carotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good
peripheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much
improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
synovitis.  
 
Clinical Impression:
 
#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the
Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  
 
#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
disease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.  Patient
advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.  He has
been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
that he continue to do so.  He will follow-up with me shortly after
the ultrasound study.

S:   Here for follow up of his colonic polyps.  He wants to know the results from

     them.  He is not taking hydrochlorothiazide and is curious about his blood

     pressure.  He said he has cut his alcohol back to 6 pack once a week.  He

     has cut back his cigarettes to one time per week.  He does say he has had

     some problems with his memory recently, although no other manifestations

     of dementia and no difficulty with ADLs.  He says he uses Viagra

     occasionally and it works for him.

     (2)  Cigarette smoking.  Discussed.

     (3)  Hypertension. Under good control.

     (4)  Elevated lipids.  Will check FLP.

     (5)  Worried about dementia. Will check B12, TSH, RPR for now.

     (6)  Status-post knee replacement.  Gets occasional Vicodin from his

          orthopedist.  Says he wanted 8 Percocet for the next month or two

          that he will take on rare occasions when his pain is more severe, and I

          did give him 8 Percocet.



P:   Follow up with Dr. Hobbs in 3 months.

Reason for Visit

Sternal pain.



History of Present Illness

71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80. He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed. The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath. No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g., leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm. The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).

 

ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail. He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

Physical Exam

      General Appearance

Alert, no acute distress, comfortable lying flat on exam table.

      HEENT

PERRL.

Moist mucous membranes.



      Neck

No visible JVD.

No cervical nodes.



      Chest

Lungs clear, good air movement, no crackles, wheezes. No focal rhonchi. No pleural rub.

+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth. No sternal movement wiht palpation. No palpable sternal wire.



      Cor/Cardiac

RRR, + systolic murmur, no rub. ?S4.

      Abdomen

Soft, ND, NT. + bowel sounds.

      Extremity

Warm. No edema.



Lab Test

ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis. IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF. Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.



Impression

Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago. Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site. No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection. Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause. Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.

 

Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:





Plan

- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low

- check CXR

- send ESR, CBC/Diff

- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done

- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware

- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

OROZCO,KYLE   560-40-78-5                     VISIT DATE: 08/26/83

This is a preliminary dictation. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 

patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 

diabetes who presents with fever and chills.  He is four weeks 

status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 

infected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now 

presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 

his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 

taking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has 

had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 

for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. 

MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. 

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 

179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 

degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some 

crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The 

heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and 

non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, 

questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities 

are well-perfused. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 

normal.  The blood sugar is 180.  The white count is normal at 3.7. 

The hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is 

negative so far, with microscopic pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. 

The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 

patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. 

Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 

history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 

who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 

a fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery 

consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 

pending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 

Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 

disposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 

condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with complaints of chest pain and throat tightness.  The patient 
reported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night 
and apparently got very tense.  He felt some heat from his car, 
thought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain 
and throat tightness.  He really described what seems to be 
fleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of 
breath, and no arm numbness or tingling.  However, he did have one 
associated symptom of some throat tightness. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a stress test one year 
ago that was normal.  He had an echocardiogram at that time that 
was also normal. 
MEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Proventil, and cimetidine. 
ALLERGIES:  Morphine sulfate. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile. 
Vital signs are normal.  HEENT:  Normal.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS: 
Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without 
murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  EXTREMITIES:  Negative. 
No CVA tenderness. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  There is no 
change in his electrocardiogram.  Chest x-ray is clear.  CK is 155. 
Troponin is 0.13.  Electrolytes are normal.  BUN and creatinine are 
20 and 1.0.  Hematocrit is 39, white count normal. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with a fleeting episode of chest pain and throat tightness while 
stuck in traffic.  He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and 
then sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical 
examination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic 
panel.  Most likely low probability for ischemia.  Risk factors are 
also very low. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):   The patient is 
going to be admitted to the Short Stay Unit for a rule out MI 
protocol and possibly for another ETT.

Dear Dr. Law:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.  His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.  Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.

Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.  The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.  The P-wave is 5.6 mV.  The R-wave is 31.3 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.

In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.  His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.  There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.  However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.  Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.  I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.  For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.  I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Gordon:



I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.



His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.  We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.  He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.  However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.  He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.



Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.  The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.  The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.



In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.  However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.  I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.  In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.  Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.  Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.  



I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.  If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Swanson:



I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.  He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.  He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.  Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.  He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.  



He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.  His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.  He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.  He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

HESS, CLARENCE

07/08/2060


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has not had recurrent angina.  Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.  We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.  Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.

He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.  He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.

MEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.  He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.  It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.  His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.  His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.  His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.  His lung fields are clear.  He has no cardiac murmur.  There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.

His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.  In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.  It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.  We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.

He will continue his efforts at weight loss.  He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.

VALENZUELA,BRIAN   036-89-96-4

The patient was seen by the resident, seen and examined by me.  I 

have taken the history and reviewed the medical record as well as 

the vital signs, medication and allergy list as well as the past 

medical history.   

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Fever of unknown cause with mental status 

change.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 51-year-old man with a 

history of multiple sclerosis, initially diagnosed in 2063 and also 

a history of hypertension, history of anemia and has sacral 

decubitus that has been debrided in the past who was transferred to 

the emergency department today from a nursing facility.  The 

patient is bedridden for the last few years and today the nursing 

home personnel noted confusion and the patient had a fever.  The 

nursing personnel at the nursing home also, after speaking with 

them states that he has chronic abdominal distention at baseline. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for fevers and chills.  Negative for 

abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain or palpitations.  The 

patient also has no urinary symptoms.  He also denies a cough, 

denies neck stiffness and denies a headache.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient wears a condom cath at baseline.

MEDICATIONS:  Baclofen, atenolol, Lactulose and Lasix as well as 

vitamin E.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Here his temperature is 101.8. 

He is tachycardic with a pulse rate of 112, respiratory rate 24 but 

he is maintaining a normal blood pressure of 131/79.  His oxygen 

saturation is also 99%.  GENERAL:  He is awake and alert, in no 

distress.  He is communicative but some times difficult to 

understand.  He is oriented x2.  He is somewhat dysarthric.  His 

dysarthria is at his baseline according to nursing personnel.  

HEENT:  Otherwise normal.  He has no evidence of an ear infection.  

His oropharyngeal examination is normal.  He has no 

lymphadenopathy.  NECK:  Supple and nontender.  There is no 

cervical adenopathy.  No signs of meningitis.  Full range of 

motion.  Normal flexion and extension.  LUNGS:  Clear.  No rhonchi 

heard.  No wheezes or rales heard.  Good air movement bilaterally.  

CARDIAC:  Tachycardic but no murmurs or rubs appreciated.  No 

friction rub.  The patient is well perfused.  Pulses are normal 

throughout.  Good capillary refill.  SKIN:  Warm to the touch 

indicating good perfusion.  Warm and dry.  No lesions seen.  He has 

a right gluteal ulcer but is healing.  ABDOMEN:  Somewhat distended 

and mildly tympanitic but no tenderness, no guarding, rebound or 

masses.  No liver edge palpated.  No spleen edge palpated and no 

evidence of a hernia.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Again, it is soft 

and nontender. GENITOURINARY:  He has a condom cath.  Cloudy urine 

in the Foley.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Normal examination.  He is 

somewhat contracted in his lower extremities but for the most part, 

no evidence of ulceration and no pedal edema.  There is no evidence 

of trauma.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Grossly intact.  Oriented x2 with some 

dysarthria at baseline.  RECTAL:  Heme negative with good rectal 

tone.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray was done which showed no 

evidence of an infection, no evidence of a pneumonia.  Because of 

his abdominal distention, a KUB was done but there was no evidence 

of air fluid levels and no evidence of intestinal obstruction.  He 

had a lot of gas but otherwise normal.  There was also no evidence 

of constipation.  Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with some 

nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Old electrocardiogram was 

compared with new one and there was no significant change.  His 

white count was 14,000 with a hematocrit of 36.  His electrolytes, 

BUN and creatinine as well as blood sugar was normal.  Amylase and 

lipase, also normal.  Liver function tests, normal.  Urinalysis 

showed too numerous to count white cells and also has bacteria.    

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Management in the emergency 

department consisted of IV fluids.  Blood cultures and urine 

cultures were sent.  The patient was immediately started on 

intravenous antibiotics, was given Tylenol, placed on oxygen and 

was being hydrated.  Again, a urine culture was sent as well as 

blood cultures.  A 51-year-old man with a history of multiple 

sclerosis, bedridden, also has a history of hypertension who has 

been experiencing fever, chills, tachycardia, tachypnea and mental 

status change over the last twenty-four hours at his nursing home 

who presents now with urosepsis.  Cultures done, antibiotics given, 

IV fluids given, Tylenol given.  Vital signs are normalizing.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Medical.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Urosepsis. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

going to be admitted to the medical service.  The patient is 

admitted to the medical service in stable condition.  Primary care 

physician is aware.

EDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^10/15/92^BENSON, KAILEE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Otis. I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 55-year-old male with vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with end-stage multiple

sclerosis as well as neurogenic bladder and chronic indwelling

Foley who presents from the nursing home after 4 episodes of

vomiting since 10:00 a.m.  He has had also progressive abdominal

distention, he reports over the last 3-4 weeks.  Nursing note

also reports decreased urine output for the last 2 days.  He had

a KUB done at the referring facility that demonstrated a question

of a small bowel obstruction but this film was not sent with him.

 He also had a fever today per report.  The patient denies any

abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or other

complaints.  He does have a history of an ileus and prior

admissions for urosepsis with levofloxacin resistant E. coli.  He

reports a mild cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, multiple

sclerosis, anemia, decubitus ulcers, neurogenic bladder, and

urethral strictures.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He is status post urethral stenting.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Actonel, ferrous sulfate, aspirin,

multivitamins, lisinopril, Lipitor, and Prilosec.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, generally

chronically ill appearing, quite pleasant.  Vital signs are

within normal limits as documented except for an elevated pulse

rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24, room air

saturations of 93% and a temperature of 99.2.  For full physical

exam findings, please see the resident's written note. 

Specifically, HEENT exam is atraumatic.  There is a 1-cm ulcer on

roof of his mouth.  He has synechiae of his pupils that are 2 mm

and nonreactive.  His extraocular movements are not alignment. 

Neck exam is normal as documented.  Respiratory exam reveals

scattered bronchi.  There is no chest wall tenderness. 

Cardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia without murmur. 

Abdominal exam is distinctly distended and slightly firm with

hypoactive bowel sounds but no tenderness, no rebound or

guarding.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry on my exam. 

Musculoskeletal exam is nontender with no edema or bony point

tenderness.  Neurologically, the patient has increased tone in

his lower extremities and weakness of all of his extremities. 

His mood and affect is normal but he is dysarthric.  He is

neurologically, however, appears to be at his baseline.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count 16.2, BUN and creatinine ratio of 40 and 1.0 respectively. 

Last creatinine was 0.5.  LFTs and lipase are within normal

limits as documented.  INR is 1.1.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific

ST-T wave changes.  Plain films of the abdomen demonstrates

scattered dilated loops of small bowel but no clear obstruction

consistent with possible ileus versus early obstruction.  Chest

x-ray shows low lung volumes without any focal consolidation.

IMPRESSION:  This is a patient with abdominal distention, is

quite impressive as well as a firm belly with dilated loops of

bowel on his KUB as well as history of vomiting earlier this

evening.  He has had no vomiting here and does not feel

nauseated, however, does not have an appetite.  He has had

decreased urine output and managed to put out a total 25 cc of

urine through his Foley since 2:00 p.m. today.  Presently, he was

not tender over his bladder.  Upon flushing the Foley, there is a

large amount of debris.  They came out and followed by high

pressure urine that had malodorous character to it.  I think this

patient likely has an ileus and urinary tract infection.  He

received antibiotics wide spectrum including vancomycin,

levofloxacin and Flagyl initially followed by gentamicin given

his prior levofloxacin resistance.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary tract infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Ileus versus SBO.

The patient was admitted to the ED Observation Area for CT

imaging, however will eventually require admission for this

problem likely to Medicine Service.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to ED Observation Unit.

EDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^08/09/93^BOYER, DAWN

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and

discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says

yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old

gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.  He has indwelling

Foley catheter.  He was transported from nursing home to ED as he

has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.  Per EMS, they were

told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased

POs today.  He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.  He

then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more

awake and alert.  He is telling the paramedics that he is at his

baseline.  He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.  No chest

pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers

or chills.  He reports that he is able to discern when he has

abdominal pain.  He has intact sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.  In addition, CAD, diabetes,

hypertension, CHF.

Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.  He does not drink.  He is at

a nursing home.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no

distress.  Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure

102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.  HEENT exam: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Supple.  He has coarse

upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart is regular

rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is slightly distended.  He is

nontender.  He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,

no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower

extremities.  He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.

The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his

urinary tract infection.  His urine and his catheter was cloudy. 

Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the

lab, the patient had his catheter changed.  He then began to no

longer drain urine.  Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on

using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. 

Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were

unsuccessful.  There was pus found at the meatus.  At this point,

the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology

evaluation.  He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI

and/or abscess.

LABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,

bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136.  LFTs

within normal limits.  Normal lipase.  White count of 5.7,

hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.  Coags within normal

limits.  UA again is pending at this time.

He will be admitted to the hospital.  I attempted to reach the

patient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the

WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.  At this point, I

am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and

urology evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.

Record date: 2132-10-01

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75 year old right handed man with pure motor hemiparesis synrdrome on right from L IC stroke in 6/32.



History of Present Illness	

Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left-sided weakness starting in 6/25/32. He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.



He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have "flashing lights in both eyes" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.



Past Medical History	

Hypertension.

He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis. 

He has not had his cholesterol checked.



Medications	    

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

HCTZ (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)	 12.5MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32

CLONIDINE HCL	 0.2MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

ZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL)	 40MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32

ASA (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID)	 81MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32



Allergies	  

NKDA	      



Social History	

lives in Avenal. Retired journalist. Widowed.

quit smoking in June, former 1 ppd x 60 years.

EtOH: couple of drinks 1-2 times per week.



Family History	

HTN in mother, aunt. 

Father died of cancer. 

No stroke



Review of Systems	

denies chest pain, SOB, palpitations.





Exam	

HEENT: NC/AT, O/P clear. Neck supple, no bruits.

Lungs: CTA bilaterally.    CV: RRR, no M/R/G. 

Abd: soft, NT/ND, + BS.    EXT: no CCE

Neuro: A, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. Naming, repetition intact. STM 3/3 at 5 min. Follows 3-step R/L commands. 

CN: VFFTC, EOMI without nystagmus. PERRL     

facial sensation, symmetry and strength intact. Hearing intact bilaterally. Palate moves symmetrically. SCM strength full bilaterally. Tongue midline. 

Motor: nl bulk and tone. Power 5/5 throughout. No drift.

Sensation: intact to LT, PP, temp, vib, PS throughout. 

Coord: nl FNF, HKS bilaterally. Gait normal-based, good toe, heel and tandem walk. 

DTR's: 2 throughout, toes downgoing.



Plan	

I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome. I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.



In addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids. 



He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds. 



He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.

Record date: 2132-12-31

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75-year-old S/P L internal capsule stroke 6/32.



Reason for Visit	

Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease. He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.



Medications	  

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID x 87 days Start Date: 10/1/32 Stop Date: 12/27/32

ATENOLOL	 50MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32

NORVASC (AMLODIPINE)	 2.5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32



Exam	

Alert, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. 

EOM's full, no nystagmus. 

Face symmetric, full power x 4. No drift. 

Gait steady, narrow-based. 



Plan	

I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management. We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule. The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver. I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.
